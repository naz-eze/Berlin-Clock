Implement the Berlin Clock as a function of the three parameters : hours (24-based), minutes, seconds and return a multi-line string. 
The time is calculated by adding the lit rectangular lamps.

* The next line consist of **4** red rectangular lamps, and every lamp represents 5 hours.
* The next line consist of **4** red rectangular lamps, and every lamp represents 1 hour.
* The next line consist of **11** rectangular lamps, and every lamp represents 5 minutes. The 3rd, 6th, and 9th are red indicating the first quarter, half, and the last quarter of the hour, while the rest are yellow. 
* The last line consist of **4** yellow lamps, and every lamp represents 1 minute.
